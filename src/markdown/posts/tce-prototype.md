title: '4hp Prototype of Two Comparator Effect'

I have been working on a version of cyberboy666's
:a[two_comparator_effect]{.https://github.com/cyberboy666/two_comparator_effect}, which I call TCE.
The :a[prototype is working]{href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtZ2dQ727Hc"}, and I have used it
in some of my live video art performances in support of live bands and DJs at shows and parties at
:a[Light Rail Studios]{.https://www.lightrailstudios.com} in San Francisco. It's been a great
addition to my video set up.

This circuit was originally designed by :a[Rob Schafer]{.https://www.youtube.com/c/schaferob} and
later improved by :a[cyberboy666]{.https://github.com/cyberboy666}. I talked with
cyberboy666 about whether it would be okay for me to create this Eurorack version, and he said that
it's open hardware so I should feel free to do so. If you are interested in his design, which leaves
the electronic components exposed and operates on a dedicated +5v wall wart power supply, you can
get his :a[version]{.https://underscores.shop/product/two_comparator_effect} on the
:a[underscores]{.https://underscores.shop} website.

I hope I have contributed to the lineage of of this circuit's design by converting it to a Eurorack
module. In the spirit of this, I decided to put the open hardware logo on the front panel rather
than my normal octopus logo. I also have the
:a[KiCAD files published on GitHub]{.https://github.com/octovolt/TCE}.

You can see it working in the video below, on the
:a[Octovolt YouTube channel]{.https://www.youtube.com/@Octovolt-os2up}.

The front panel holes were a little too small for Alpha 9mm potentiometers, so I had to use tall
trim pots instead. I have revised the front panel to allow the Alpha pots, and I was able to
improve the PCB a bit as well. As a result, it should be a little bit easier to build. And with the
Alpha potentiometers offering more connections between the PCB and the front panel, the whole thing
will be a lot more sturdy.

Currently, as I write this post, I'm waiting for the new PCBs and panels to come back from the
fabrication house. When I get them back and test them, assuming everything works as it should, this
will be the second Octovolt module. As you might imagine, I'm pretty excited about it.

I plan to create a different version of TCE (still thinking about the name, but maybe Thresholds)
which will be designed for 0-1v RGBY signals rather than composite video, and it will offer CV
control and some alternate outputs.

Working on this module has led me to think a lot about how comparators can be used in video
circuits. After studying some of the
:a[Sandin Image Processor]{.https://scanlines.xyz/t/diy-resources-file-system/224} circuits on
:a[scanlines.xyz]{.https://scanlines.xyz}, while also thinking about comparators, I started
developing an "edge rendering" circuit. You can take a look at my progress on that circuit on my
personal :a[Instagram account]{.https://www.instagram.com/_bill_fisher_/}, especially :a[this
post]{.https://www.instagram.com/p/Cz06LWLrpfc}, and
:a[this post]{.https://www.instagram.com/p/Cz-ZmENrnEA}, and
:a[this post]{.https://www.instagram.com/p/C0Ju9wTrKbt}. I
:a[built a prototype]{.https://www.instagram.com/p/C1lhF7KLRKA} of this circuit on David Haillant's
:a[Eurorack Stripboard]{.https://www.davidhaillant.com/eurorack-stripboard-1-3/},
and the documentation for that is also
:a[up on Github]{.https://github.com/octovolt/SlowEdgeStripboard}. But a better, more polished
version of it is coming soon.

Another thing that has emerged through my work on the TCE, and the other circuits where I use
comparators, is the fact that the comparator in the TCE (and the original two_comparator_effect) is
actually a little bit too slow for video. The comparator in question is the
:a[LM339]{.https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm339.pdf}, which is cheap, widely available, and comes
in a through-hole quad package. Unfortunately, it has a response time of about 1.3 microseconds,
and for accurate video work we would want a response time under 83 microseconds (according to my
calculations for NTSC 720Ã—480 video -- please [contact](/contact) me if I'm wrong). The resulting
image from the LM339 is shifted very slightly to the right. You can see this pretty clearly in
:a[this post]{.https://www.instagram.com/p/C0Ju9wTrKbt/}, where the blue and red signals are going
through the LM339, while the green is not. Still, it has a cool aesthetic. The TCE's slow comparator
will not be perceivable unless one mixes the output with the original signal (or an accurate version
of the original), like I did in that post. Regardless, with the circuits I'm currently developing,
I'm going to use a faster comparator. I'm still working out which one to use.
